# To-Do-List


<h2>Overview</h2>
This Project is a personal one (yet, made public ... LoL).This contains simple scripts such as BMI calculator.
The aim is to help boost my python skills and problem solving approach.

The scripts are expected to progress from simple functions to more rigorous ones, developed
to have more complexity, addressing other possible conditions/scenat involved.

<h3>To-the-viewer</h3>
let's have some fun! 

<pre>
viewer_idea = input("Do you have an idea to improve one of these scripts? (yes/no): ")

#Check if the viewer has an idea to improve any script
  
if viewer_idea.lower() == "yes":  
    print("Feel free to share your new idea with me!")  
else:  
    print("Hope you learnt a thing or two!")
